# cyTree
**cyTree** is a lightweight R package that implements a custom tree structure for 
hierarchical annotation of clusters, designed for cytometry data analysis workflows 
such as those used in CyCadas. It enables programmatic construction, manipulation, 
and traversal of parentâ€“child relationships between annotated cell populations or clusters.
